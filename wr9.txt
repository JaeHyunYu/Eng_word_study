Effective learning requires time, comfort and peace, so it is impossible to combine study and employment. Study and employment distract one from another. To what extent do you think the statements are realistic? support your opinion with examples.

Many people argue that balancing study and employment is challenging. The main reason for this opinion is that effective learning requires time, and it leads to it being impossible to combine study and employment. In my opinion, the statements are quite realistic, but it depends on how much one likes their job or major.
In usuall, most of people dissatisfied with their job or major. These days, cause of the financial inflation, people have to earn money quickly even if they do not want to .To support their family or save money for future aspects, they have to be hired quickly. These reasons make someone afraid to find what they like to do and which job they are good at.

On the contrary, if someone loves their major and wants to work in a related field, I think  it is possible to combine study and employment. Because, someone who is interested in their major, preparation for employment is the same as their study. Futhermore it leads to  diversitifying someone's skills, and it is related to their successful employment.

To conclude, the statements about combining study and employment depend on a person's personality and circumstances. However, coinciding the interests and job lead you to irreplaceable expert in your group and it will be much valuable for your future prospects.
