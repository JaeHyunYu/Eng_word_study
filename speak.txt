"I usually go to a cafe to relax, and I do quite a lot of things there. Firstly, I usually study, such as programming or solving some hacking issues. As I mentioned, I work in the IT field, so I have to study a lot. You know, new techniques emerge every single day, and I have to deal with them.

Secondly, I go there when I have some troubles. I take a rest for about an hour, and it really helps me figure out how to handle the problems.

Lastly, I go there to meet my friends. I think a cafe is the best place to come together and have some daily conversation. I love its peaceful atmosphere. So, for these reasons, I prefer going to a cafe to relax myself."
